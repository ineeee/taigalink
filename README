taiga.link
==========
this branch is a fork (kinda) of taiga.link, powers the pastebin at wolowolo.com


pastes
------
how to:

    curl http://paste.wolowolo.com/p/upload -d "text=some text to paste here"

it'll return the full url to the paste. the python script just writes it to a
text file and its served by nginx.


url shortener
-------------
how to:

    curl http://paste.wolowolo.com/s/short -d "url=https://example.org/"

returns the url to the shortened link. this fork focuses on SIMPLICITY and LOW
TRAFFIC. all links are thrown into a .json file


how to run
----------
add the nginx config to your nginx server. then run this script:

    git clone https://github.com/inexist3nce/taigalink.git
    cd taigalink
    python3 server.py


TODO
----
- document how the whole "server side includes" thing works
- make things expire after a few days. that's why it stores timestamps after all
